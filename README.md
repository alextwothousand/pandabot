# PandaBot.py
Source code for PandaBot, a Discord Bot created by myself in Python.
# REQUIREMENTS
    The latest version of discord.py (THIS DOES NOT USE DISCORD.PY REWRITE!)
    You will need Python 3.5.3 or above (as a general rule of thumb you should stick with 3.6.6)
    It is preferred that this bot is hosted on a VPS rather than your PC locally, if to be made commercial.   
# NOTES
All of the commands OTHER THAN THE `$hello` command will show up in the `$help` list. This is due to the fact that hello uses `def on_message` rather than defining it as a command. You may also get a error in the console due to the `$hello` command not being defined as a command however that can be ignored. This can be easily fixed by using `ctx/context`, you can read up on at the discord.py API.

Under the `$hello` command you can put in your client ID so that it shows `'Hello there my father, my creator, my overlord'` rather than `'Hello there NAME'`.

The token is easily changeable by modifying `botprefix` and the `$hello` command however I may push a new update in the future which turns `$hello` into an actual defined command.

This probably wasn't programmed the best way possible and you could probably incorporate it with some sort of database, for example, asyncpg (PostrgeSQL with async - which is reccomended as SQLite and MySQL are blocking), to add a sort of credits system or something similar to that.

If there are any further issues or you wish to contact me create a `issue` and I will respond asap. Enjoy and have fun!
