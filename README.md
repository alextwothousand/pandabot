# PandaBot.py
Source code for PandaBot, a Discord Bot created by myself in Python.
# REQUIREMENTS
    The latest version of discord.py (THIS DOES NOT USE DISCORD.PY REWRITE!)
    You will need Python 3.5.3 or above (as a general rule of thumb you should stick with 3.6.6)
    It is preferred that this bot is hosted on a VPS rather than your PC locally, if to be made commercial.   
# NOTES
updated and most issues were fixed.

If there are any further issues or you wish to contact me create a `issue` and I will respond asap. Enjoy and have fun!

DOUBLE TRIPLE EXTRA OOF NOTE: Latest copies will be commited but no longer placed in releases, so you'll essentially have to grab them from here!
